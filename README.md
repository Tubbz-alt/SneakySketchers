## 🙋 What is Sneaky Sketchers?

Have you ever taken a photo in which there is some unneeded object in the background, ever taken a photo and someone just walked behind you, and now you feel the photo is not as good as it could have been? 📷 

If so, worry not! This desktop application alllows you to select the areas in a photo you want to remove by drawing on them. Once you're done, the app will erase the objects you drew on, and generate a new photo which would look as if those obejcts were never present! 🔥

You can also use this application for having some fun. Ever wondered how you would look without a moustache, or with spectacles? Or wondered how your face would like with different features? Well draw over your face, and let the app do the magic! 👦 👧
